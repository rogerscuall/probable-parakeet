  # 1. Core Service - Required
  - id: tgw_core
    name: Core TGW Infrastructure
    description: Base Transit Gateway deployment in a single region
    explanation: |
      Deploys the AWS Transit Gateway service to a single region in an existing client account.
      Includes permission configuration.

      **Common Scenarios:**
      - Establishing a centralized regional network hub
      - Replacing complex VPC peering meshes with a hub-and-spoke topology
      - Preparing a foundation for future multi-region expansion

  # 2. TGW Configuration - Required
  - id: tgw_configuration
    name: TGW Settings
    description: MTU, Encryption, and Propagation settings
    explanation: |
      Configures global TGW attributes including:
      - Default route table association/propagation
      - DNS support
      - VPN ECMP support
      - MTU size
      - Tagging strategies

      **Common Scenarios:**
      - Enforcing standardized tagging for cost allocation and automation
      - Optimizing MTU (e.g., 8500 bytes) for high-throughput workloads
      - Enabling ECMP to scale VPN bandwidth across multiple tunnels

  # 3. Route Tables - Optional
  - id: route_tables
    name: Route Tables
    description: Custom route tables and static routes
    explanation: |
      Configure up to (4) TGW route tables.
      Support for up to (12) additional static routes per table.

      **Common Scenarios:**
      - Routing traffic to on-premises networks via Transit Gateway
      - Directing traffic to specific NAT instances or firewalls
      - Creating blackhole routes for traffic filtering
      - Overriding default routing behavior

  # 4. VPC Attachments - Optional
  - id: vpc_attachments
    name: VPC Attachments
    description: Attach existing spoke VPCs
    explanation: |
      Attach up to (8) existing spoke VPCs to the TGW.
      Includes configuration of necessary AZ attachments and updates to
      up to (3) VPC route tables per VPC to support connectivity.

      **Common Scenarios:**
      - Integrating isolated workload VPCs (Dev, Test, Prod) into the network
      - Connecting Shared Services VPCs to consumer VPCs
      - Retrofitting existing "brownfield" VPCs with transit connectivity
